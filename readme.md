----------
## Overview
This package can be used to create complex input forms. Multiple input fields can be arranged in rows or in 
several columns.

In addition to the 'usual' form elements, the package contains an element for entering color values 
and a range element to which a label can be assigned, in which the current selection of the slider is 
automatically displayed. 

Additionaly the package contains JavaScript-based pickers for 
- date fields
- time fields
- color fields

and integrated JS validation of
- date values
- time values
- numerical values (integer, floating point and currency fields).

The input formats can be configured to meet country-specific requirements.
The design can be completely adapted to your own needs using an individual stylesheet.

The package also contains an element that can be used to integrate the WYSIWYG editor 'CKEditor 4' into a form. The complete 
configuration is done from the PHP side. A connector to the open source file manager 'RichFilemanager' is included for 
selecting graphics or to create links to other files on the server.
